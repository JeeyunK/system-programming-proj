w to use Linux kernel crypto compression

-v0.1 2018.10.8 Sherlock init



This doc shares the crypto compression API in Linux kernel.



Linux kernel crypto subsystem supports different algorithms including compression

algorithms. A hardware or software implementation can be added to crypto

subsystem to do specific work.



If you have a hardware module to do Zlib/Gzip compressions, you can write a

driver, which can be registered into Linux kernel crypto subsystem.

To use this hardware to do compression, you need not care about hardware detail,

only thing you need to know is crypto API, here, you should know crypto compress

related API.



Firstly, we should create a crypto compression context using:

We only consider synchronized API crypto_alloc_comp here.(struct crypto_comp)
