How to use Linux kernel crypto compression

-v0.1 2018.10.8 Sherlock init



This doc shares the crypto compression API in Linux kernel.



Linux kernel crypto subsystem supports different algorithms including compression

algorithms. A hardware or software implementation can be added to crypto

subsystem to do specific work.



If you have a hardware module to do Zlib/Gzip compressions, you can write a
    
driver, which can be registered into Linux kernel crypto subsystem.
